## 💡 Core Concepts
- 📦 **Maven Dependencies** — managing external libraries through `pom.xml`  
- 🔌 **JDBC Driver Loading** — enabling Java to communicate with MySQL  
- 🌐 **Database URLs** — defining host, port, and schema for connection  
- 🧵 **PreparedStatement** — safe, parameterized SQL execution  
- 🗃️ **ResultSet Processing** — retrieving data row-by-row  
- 🔄 **try-with-resources** — automatic closing of JDBC resources  
- 🗄️ **DataSource** — modern connection management  
- 🧩 **DAO Pattern** — separating database logic from application logic  
- 🛠️ **CRUD Operations** — inserting, updating, deleting, and retrieving data  
- 📞 **Stored Procedures** — executing predefined SQL logic from Java

### ✨ Final Slay Note  
Connecting Java to a real database is where applications start feeling *alive*.  
Write clean queries, manage connections responsibly, and let your JDBC code slay — safely and efficiently. 💅⚡
